# Agricultural-Data-Exploration
This repository contains an in-depth exploration of agricultural data aimed at identifying key factors affecting crop yield. The dataset includes various agricultural features such as soil type, irrigation methods, rainfall, temperature, and farming practices. The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations that can help improve farming practices and decision-making.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and data transformation for better analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between crop yield and various factors like soil type, elevation, rainfall, and irrigation.
Statistical Analysis: Conducting hypothesis tests to determine significant relationships between features.
Visualization: Creating insightful plots such as violin plots and correlation heatmaps.

Technologies Used:
Python for data analysis.
Pandas for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn (if applicable for future machine learning models).

Conclusion
This analysis highlights important relationships between environmental and farming factors that affect crop yield. The findings can assist farmers and agricultural planners in making more informed decisions regarding soil management, irrigation practices, and crop selection.
